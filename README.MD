# Project: .NET Version of MaterialDocs with Redis Caching and MicroService Architecture

## Rest of Week (Jan 10-12)

- **January 10, 2023**:
  - Create a basic controller and service for my Material Project.

- **January 11, 2023**:
  - Revisit Redis to integrate caching for time-intensive GPT API calls.

- **January 12, 2023**:
  - Finish an ElasticSearch course (6 hours):
    [Complete ElasticSearch Masterclass with Kibana and Logstash](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-elasticsearch-masterclass-with-kibana-and-logstash).

## Weekend (Jan 13 - Jan 14)

Will likely spend any available time trying to really ground myself in C# & Angular. They're still new to me, and I find myself looking up how to do things somewhat frequently.

## Next Week (Jan 14 - Jan 19)

- **Material Doc Frontend**:
  - Create a basic RichText input.
  - Work on a more useful/interactive UI for documentation, involving Users/Researchers, Comments, Tags, Graphs, and possibly an annotation feature.
- Explore Caching More.
- Learn introductory .NET microservices (to work on more in week 2).
- Figure out how to integrate ElasticSearch in Demo projects.

## Week 2 (Jan 22 - Jan 26)

- Revisit a DB2 course and try to successfully configure (again).
- Work deeper on .NET Microservices.
- Look at how I can break down MaterialDocs into services.
- Completely configure caching for MaterialDocs.
- Have a better UX for looking up Materials (currently done by ID from Material Project).
- Have a high-fidelity Angular MVP of the frontend for MaterialDocs by the end of this week.
