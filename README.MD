# Project: .NET Version of MaterialDocs with Redis Caching

## Project Timeline

- **January 10, 2023**:
  - Created a basic controller and service for my Material Project.

- **January 11, 2023**:
  - Revisited Redis to integrate caching for time-intensive GPT API calls.

- **January 12, 2023**:
  - Completed an ElasticSearch course (6 hours):
    [Complete ElasticSearch Masterclass with Kibana and Logstash](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-elasticsearch-masterclass-with-kibana-and-logstash).

## Weekend (November 13 - November 14)

Will likely spend any available time trying to really ground myself in C# & Angular. They're still new to me, and I find myself looking up how to do things somewhat frequently.

## Next Week (November 14 - November 19)

- **Material Doc Frontend**:
  - Created a basic RichText input.
  - Working on a more useful/interactive UI for documentation, involving Users/Researchers, Comments, Tags, Graphs, and possibly an annotation feature.
- **Exploring Caching More**.
- Learning introductory .NET microservices (to work on more in week 2).
- Figuring out how to integrate ElasticSearch in Demo projects.

## Week 2 (November 22 - November 26)

- Revisited a DB2 course and tried to configure it successfully (again).
- Working deeper on .NET Microservices.
- Looking at how to break down MaterialDocs into services.
- Completing the configuration of caching for MaterialDocs.
- Enhancing the UX for looking up Materials (currently done by ID from Material Project).
- Aiming to have a high-fidelity Angular MVP of the frontend for MaterialDocs by the end of this week.
